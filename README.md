# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe
The AI-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a Python interactive system where players compete against an AI. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, while the AI makes random moves. The game checks for winning conditions or a draw after each turn, offering a fun and simple experience of the classic board game with AI integration.
